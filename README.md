[Automate your flag](https://youtu.be/u8v3oIk314g) using node.js, websockets and NodeMCU!

**Note:** You will need to build and run all three ollie projects

## Purpose
Connect your flag to the internet and move it up and down anywhere in the world.

## How it works
Simply push a button to go up or down.

**Note:** Get the ip address of the server.  You will need to change the IP_ADDRESS variable in the other ollie-react-native and ollie-arudino to move your flag.
